		I worked as an intern lighting artist at Crytek on Ryse: Son of Rome from October 2013 to August 2014. 
		<br><br>
		During the employment I was responsible for lighting the first mission: <i>The Beginning</i> and the last 
		mission: <i>Son of Rome</i> as well as the cinematics linked to those missions while following the art direction. 
		Additionally I did in-engine renders for some of the marketing material,  worked on developing the lighting pipeline 
		with the other lighting artists and worked with the rendering engineers: giving feedback on the development of the 
		physicalized shading pipeline and lighting features for the project.
